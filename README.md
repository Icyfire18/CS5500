# Project Title: MuSE (Museum visualzation with Software Engineering)

## Project Description: 
This project aims to address the declining enthusiasm towards museum visits and the threat of climate change on museum preservation by leveraging information visualization concepts. The focus is on creating a software-oriented application, specifically a website, to visually demonstrate the impact of climate change on increasing maintenance costs for museums. The project involves setting up a SQLite database to store and modify relevant data, a frontend to visualize and update the website, and a modal to predict data for information visualization. The goal is to dynamically showcase the need for conservation measures through live visualizations that auto-refresh with the latest data, providing a compelling and interactive platform for raising awareness about the challenges faced by museums in the context of climate change.

## Project Hosted: [MuSE](https://muse.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Features:
1. __User Registeration & Authentication System__: Allow users to register for an account and log in to access the website's services.
2. **Data Vizualization**: System provides various interactive features including tooltip.
3. **Safety**: System doesn't expose sensitive data and unauthorized access.
4. **Business Rules**: Multiple Business Rules in place.
5. **Compliance**: Teh website complies with various data protection and privacy laws, including GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

## Team Style: 
**Open** (all work on different tasks reviewing and providing feedback to each other)

## Process Model: 
**Waterfall Methodology**
1. Requirements gathering and analysis. 
2. System design 
3. Implementation 
4. Testing 
5. Deployment 
6. Maintenance
